# Generalised_Data_Structure_Library

This project is considered as a library which contains generic implementations of all major types of data structures
We provide the readymade implementations of all fundamental operation as well as advanced operation on linear ,non linear data strutters in an object oriented way
We provide the generic way of implementation so we can use the functionality for any type of data types
ALl the object oriented design polices are used in this project
